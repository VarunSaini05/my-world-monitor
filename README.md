## What It Does

- **500+ curated news feeds** across 15 categories, AI-synthesized into briefs
- **Dual map engine** — 3D globe (globe.gl) and WebGL flat map (deck.gl) with 56 map layer types
- **Cross-stream correlation** — military, economic, disaster, and escalation signal convergence
- **Country Instability Index (CII)** — server-authoritative CII v8 stress scoring for 31 Tier-1 countries
- **Finance radar** — 29 stock exchanges, commodities, crypto, and 7-signal market composite
- **Local AI** — run everything with Ollama, no API keys required
- **6 site variants** from a single codebase (world, tech, finance, commodity, happy, energy)
- **Native desktop app** (Tauri 2) for macOS, Windows, and Linux
- **24 languages** with native-language feeds and RTL support

For the full feature list, architecture, data sources, and algorithms, see the **[documentation](https://www.worldmonitor.app/docs/documentation)**.

## Support Status

All site variants and desktop binaries are built from a single codebase and ship from the same release process. The table below clarifies maintenance status so you know which surfaces are safe to depend on.

| Surface | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Varun World Monitor (Render deployment) | Stable | Self-hosted fork maintained by Varun Saini |
| Source Code | Active | Available at [VarunSaini05/my-world-monitor](https://github.com/VarunSaini05/my-world-monitor) |

Issues and feature requests can be filed at the [issues board](https://github.com/VarunSaini05/my-world-monitor/issues).

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VarunSaini05/my-world-monitor.git
cd my-world-monitor
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The app runs with no environment variables.

Feature-specific data sources may require credentials — for example, the flight-price command (`fly LON DXB`) needs `TRAVELPAYOUTS_API_TOKEN` to return live quotes; without it the command shows a "credentials required" message rather than synthetic data. See `.env.example` for the full list.

For variant-specific development:

```bash
npm run dev:tech       # tech.worldmonitor.app
npm run dev:finance    # finance.worldmonitor.app
npm run dev:commodity  # commodity.worldmonitor.app
npm run dev:happy      # happy.worldmonitor.app
npm run dev:energy     # energy.worldmonitor.app
```

See the **[self-hosting guide](https://www.worldmonitor.app/docs/getting-started)** for deployment options (Vercel, Docker, static).
